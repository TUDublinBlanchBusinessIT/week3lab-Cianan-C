#Add a function below called divisors(num) which takes one argument of type integer
#and returns a list of all the divisors(factors) of that that number -
#A divisor or factor is a number which divides evenly leaving no remainder

#define the funciton header called divisors expecting one argument
def divisors(num):
    
    #set up an empty list to hold your result

    result = []
 
    
    #loop i from 1 to the number you are checking (take care not to include the number itself)
    for i in range(1, num - 1):

        #if the remainder when dividing the number by i is equal to zero then i is a divisor so...
        if num % i == 0:
           
            #apend i to the list you set up
            result.append(i)

             
    #return the list
    return result


#to test the divisors function uncomment the following line it should give [1,2,3,5,6,10,15]
#print(divisors(30))
print(divisors(30))
